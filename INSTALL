hIPPYlib depends on [FEniCS](http://fenicsproject.org/) version 1.6 or
above.  The suggested version of FEniCS to use with hIPPYlib is
2016.2.

FEniCS needs to be built with the following dependecies:
- numpy, scipy, matplotlib
- PETSc and petsc4py (version 3.7.0 or above)
- SLEPc and slepc4py (version 3.7.0 or above)
- PETSc dependencies: parmetis, scotch, suitesparse, superlu_dist, ml
- (optional): mshr, jupyter

## Buid FEniCS from source using hashdist (Linux and MacOS)

To build FEniCS from source we suggest using the scripts and profile
files in `fenics-hashdist`. These scripts and profile files contain
small modifications with respect to the ones provided by the FEniCS
community to ensure that all the dependencies needed by hIPPYlib are
installed.

See `fenics-hashdist/README.md` for further details.

## Run FEniCS from Docker (Linux, MacOS, Windows)

An easy way to run FEniCS is to use their prebuilt Docker images.

First you will need to install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) on
your system.  MacOS and Windows users should preferably use `Docker
for Mac` or `Docker for Windows` --- if it is compatible with their
system --- instead of the legacy version `Docker Toolbox`.

Among the many docker's workflow discussed [here]
(http://fenics.readthedocs.io/projects/containers/en/latest/quickstart.html),
we suggest using the `Jupyter notebook`[one]
(http://fenics.readthedocs.io/projects/containers/en/latest/jupyter.html).

### Docker for Mac, Docker for Windows and Linux users (Setup and first use instructions)

We first create a new Docker container to run the 'jupyter-notebook'
command and to expose port `8888`.  From a command line shell, go to
the `hippylib` folder and type:
```
docker run --name hippylib-nb -w /home/fenics/hippylib -v $(pwd):/home/fenics/hippylib -d -p 127.0.0.1:8888:8888 quay.io/fenicsproject/stable:2016.2.0.r2 'jupyter-notebook --ip=0.0.0.0'
docker logs hippylib-nb
```
The notebook will be available at
`http://localhost:8888/?token=<security_token_for_first_time_connection>`
in your web browser.  From there you can run the interactive notebooks
or create a new shell (directly from your browser) to run python
scripts.

### Docker Toolbox users on Mac/Windows (Setup and first use instructions)

Docker Toolbox is for older Mac and Windows systems that do not meet
the requirements of `Docker for Mac` or `Docker for Windows`.  Docker
Toolbox will first create a lightweight linux virtual machine on your
system and run docker from the virtual machine.  This has implications
on the workflow presented above.

We first create a new Docker container to run the 'jupyter-notebook' command and to expose port `8888` on the virtual machine.
From a command line shell, go to the `hippylib` folder and type:
```
docker run --name hippylib-nb -w /home/fenics/hippylib -v $(pwd):/home/fenics/hippylib -d -p $(docker-machine ip $(docker-machine active)):8888:8888 quay.io/fenicsproject/stable:2016.2.0.r2 'jupyter-notebook --ip=0.0.0.0'
docker logs hippylib-nb
```
To find out the IP of the virtual machine we type:
```
docker-machine ip $(docker-machine active)
```

The notebook will be available at `http://<ip-of-virtual-machine>:8888/?token=<security_token_for_first_time_connection>` in your web browser.
From there you can run the interactive notebooks or create a new shell (directly from your browser) to run python scripts.

### Subsequent uses
The docker container will continue to run in the background until we stop it:
```
docker stop hippylib-nb
```
To start it again just run:
```
docker start hippylib-nb
```
If you would like to see the log output from the Jupyter notebook server (e.g. if you need the security token) type:
```
docker logs hippylib-nb
```

## Other ways to build FEniCS

For instructions on other ways to build FEniCS (e.g. using `Anaconda`
or `apt-get` in Ubuntu), we refer to the FEniCS project [download
page](https://fenicsproject.org/download/).  Note that this
instructions always refer to the latest version of FEniCS which may or
may not be yet supported by hIPPYlib. Always check the hIPPYlib
website for supported FEniCS versions.
